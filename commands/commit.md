description: Commit only the changes YOU made in this session
---

Review and commit ONLY the code changes that YOU (this Claude Code session) made:

## 1. Identify Your Changes
- Recall which files YOU actually modified during this conversation
- Run `git status` and `git diff` to see all current changes

## 2. Stage Only Your Files
- CRITICAL: Only stage files that YOU personally edited
- Do NOT stage files you didn't touch
- Do NOT revert changes in files you didn't work on
- If you see changes you don't recognize, LEAVE THEM ALONE (another session likely made them)
- Use `git add <specific-files>` to stage ONLY your files

## 3. Write a Quality Commit Message
Follow these guidelines:
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Make it searchable - someone should find this commit when searching for the feature/fix
- For complex changes, add a body explaining WHY (blank line after subject)

## 4. Commit
```bash
git commit -m "type(scope): description"
```
- Do NOT add "Co-authored-by" or "Generated by" trailers
- Do NOT mention Claude or AI in the commit
- Just a normal, clean commit

## 5. Do NOT Push
I will push myself using `/push` when ready.

If you're unsure whether you modified a file, ask me before staging it.
